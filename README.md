<li>âš¡ Fun fact - If you consider the approximate 200,000-year timeline of modern Homo sapiens, the year 2024 represents just a tiny fraction of that span. To put it in perspective, if you imagine compressing the entire human history into a single calendar year, with the first day representing the emergence of Homo sapiens, then the current year 2024 would only be a few seconds before midnight on December 31st. It's a fascinating way to highlight the relatively brief period of time that our modern societies have existed in the context of our species' existence.</li>
