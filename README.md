Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<h1>MhatteBoi</h1> <h3>About Me</h3> <ul> <li>ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a beginner fullstack developer exploring the web one line of code at a time. My current stack includes **C#, .NET, Angular, Next.js, Blazor, WordPress**, and **Tailwind CSS**. I also enjoy diving into tools like **Figma** for UX/UI design.</li> <li>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning! Right now, Iâ€™m focused on **React** and sharpening my skills with **Angular**. Iâ€™m also exploring cloud development with **Azure** and **Firebase** to build scalable apps.</li> <li>ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **.NET development**, **outdoor adventures**, or anything about **mountain biking** and **camping**â€”I love being in nature as much as I love coding!</li> <li>ðŸ“« Reach me at: **Mhattias.r@gmail.com**</li> <li>âš¡ Fun fact: When Iâ€™m not building apps, youâ€™ll find me exploring unconventional books, thinking about stoicism, or cooking up something tasty outdoors. (Yes, winter camping is a thing!)</li> </ul>
